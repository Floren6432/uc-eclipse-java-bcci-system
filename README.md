# uc-eclipse-java-bcci-system

A simple Java console application I created during my second year of study at university, which simulates a payroll deduction system used in the Philippines. It calculates monthly income tax, SSS, Pag-IBIG, and PhilHealth contributions based on a user's input salary.

Features:
- Prompts user to enter personal details and company name.
- Accepts monthly salary input.
- Automatically calculates:
  - Income Tax (based on BIR tax brackets)
  - SSS contribution (employee share)
  - Pag-IBIG contribution (1% or 2%)
  - PhilHealth contribution (based on salary range)
- Displays formatted deduction summary.
- Option to perform multiple inquiries.

Notes:
- SSS and PhilHealth brackets are hardcoded based on current published rates (as of development).
- For educational/demo purposes only.

Instructions:
Just download the .zip file, 
then open Eclipse and go to File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace to import it, 
or simply drop the folder into your Eclipse workspace.
